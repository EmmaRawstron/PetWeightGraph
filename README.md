# Pet Data Visualization Project

This project visualizes data from a pet dataset using Python and Plotly. The dataset includes information about the pet's ID, species, and weight. The visualization includes two subplots showing total weights by species and individual weights by pet ID.

## Data

The dataset used for this project, 'pet_data.csv', includes the following columns:

- 'petID': Unique identifier for each pet.
- 'species': The species of the pet ('cat', 'dog', or 'shinglebackLizard').
- 'weight': The weight of the pet.

## Visualization

The visualization includes two bar charts in a subplot format:

1. The top subplot shows the total weight for each species.
2. The bottom subplot shows the weight of each individual pet, grouped by species.

You can use the buttons below the title to switch between different species in the bottom subplot.
